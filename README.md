This a for the Minecraft Wurst Client. It basically helps you create .json files for Wurst AutoBuild. For now only small builds. For any suggestions, go to https://wurstforum.net/d/651-i-made-a-wurst-autobuild-creator-with-html/3

If anyone can help me with rotation that would help. (Also a zoom feature)

#   ALWAYS CHECK THE FILE!!! IF YOU SEE 'null' THIS WILL CORRUPT YOUR WORLD. TO FIX, TRY DOWNLOADING IT AGAIN AND DELETING THE OLD ONE OR REMAKE IT!
